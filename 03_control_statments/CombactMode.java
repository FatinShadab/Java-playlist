/*
 * After successfully storing the armor details and monitoring its energy efficiency,
 * Tony Stark now wants you to program the armorâ€™s combat readiness system.
 * The armor needs to analyze multiple conditions before engaging in battle.
 * 
 * The armor should only engage in combat mode if it meets the following conditions:
 * 
 * Energy level must be 50% or above.
 * Missile count must be at least 50.
 * If energy is between 50% and 79%, check if nano-tech is enabled.
 * If nano-tech is available, combat mode is activated.
 * If nano-tech is not available, armor enters defensive mode instead.
 * If energy is 80% or above, combat mode activates instantly, regardless of nano-tech.
