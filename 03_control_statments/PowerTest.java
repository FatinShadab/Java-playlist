/*
 * After successfully storing the armor details, Tony Stark is now testing the armor's energy efficiency.
 * He has asked you to write a program that determines whether the armor's power usage is optimal based 
 * on its current energy level.
 * 
 * Problem Statement:
 * The Mark 2025 armor operates at different efficiency levels based on its current energy percentage.
 * You need to write a Java program using if-else to determine the armor's efficiency status.
 * 
 * Conditions:
 * If energy >= 80%, print: "Power Level: Optimal - Ready for action!"
 * If energy is between 50% and 79%, print: "Power Level: Moderate - Consider recharging soon."
 * If energy is between 20% and 49%, print: "Power Level: Low - Recharge immediately!"
 * If energy < 20%, print: "Power Level: Critical - Emergency Shutdown Activated!"
